FoodConnect is an innovative Salesforce application designed to tackle the issue of food waste by efficiently supplying leftover food to those in need. This project connects venues, such as restaurants and catering services, with volunteers dedicated to redistributing food to the underprivileged. By streamlining the food donation process, FoodConnect not only helps alleviate hunger but also promotes sustainability by reducing food waste.

The application is built on the Salesforce platform and leverages its powerful features, including custom objects, fields, and automation capabilities. The primary components of the project include:

Custom Objects: The application features several key custom objects: Venue, Drop-Off Point, Task, Volunteer, and Execution Details. These objects work together to manage the food donation process effectively.

Field Creation: Important fields, including Distance Calculation, enable the app to determine the proximity of drop-off points and streamline the assignment of tasks to volunteers.

Automation Flows: Utilizing Salesforce flows, the application automates the assignment of tasks based on volunteer availability and location, enhancing operational efficiency.

Reports and Dashboards: FoodConnect includes robust reporting and dashboard features that provide real-time insights into volunteer activities, food distribution metrics, and task progress. This data-driven approach allows stakeholders to monitor performance and make informed decisions.

User Management: The application supports multiple user roles, ensuring that venue managers, volunteers, and administrators can interact with the system according to their specific needs. Public groups facilitate sharing records among users based on predefined criteria.

FoodConnect is an essential tool for organizations focused on social responsibility, providing a practical solution for food redistribution. This repository contains all implementation steps, configuration details, and source code necessary to replicate the application in a Salesforce environment. Your contributions and feedback are welcome as we aim to improve and expand this initiative further.
